be only thing need prove investor first time entrepreneur be proof  idea be good can work second be be right person execute scale bootstrapp  company turn be good thing that happen when alon decide bring investor do not just have idea what be go do have prove concept engaged community know how execute can not innovate make mistake way key be learn failure try again sometimes work something long time realise do not turn exactly way imagine sometimes thing that be very skeptical be open try turn be very well receive try new thing get constant feedback  user be essential integral part

vision  home no matter how small big  budget when have have bad day alon will read  app review email comment  community member know that be solve real problem be incredibly gratify make feel worthwhile  grandmother  mother be entrepreneur keep say  want something can do just be passionate something go all way be just something that be part early see work very very hard thrive even school be frustrate sometimes be just so traditional people could not think box question thing instead  mother tell have do exactly way say actually encourage think box  question thing be so supportive front want find right investor who support  vision do not want go sand hill road start pitch people just do not want do  not love what be do somebody want join investor need understand make standard pitch would just have coffee people informal environment talk what be do figure will get do not then should not be  investor be way do be very informal that be true be not forum that people be use be important say look be not go try package way that be use am not go make number powerpoint show company be go be worth make do not have crystal ball even today keep say investor that do not have crystal ball have idea what be go happen year know who be know what company be know where be go have power control day day what be do do not know what be go happen go back what  mother say when be school have way say just tell have innovative way demonstrate investor have be fine tell investor when meet restaurant think be go be feel be not right be not do way be use then just do not join  go be very very different actually like be different  husband alon be run company together say early want be pretty flat organization start idea people can be way more creative when do not have middle management how many time do engineer feel frustrated be very talented have report middle manager who be not necessarily talent point engineer just say do not want do feel do not get promote be manager then be not good enough  not true can be amazing individual contributor not necessarily even be manager so many time middle management position can just block people grow individually actually build company way that do not have middle manager all also require hire people who be very mature experience who can take everything come concept all way execute be very creative innovative entrepreneurial set goal entire company  very important everybody company understand where be go why be do what be do what other people company be do sit big open space together have company meeting few week just make sure everybody same page so talk goal own  goal  number how do get there how do achieve everything own work  just amazing let people own something be entrepreneur thrive see people be move table consult other be get immediate response  work thing move really fast small company will first walk  rsum try understand why have make certain choice be try understand what type person be choice make way make will tell lot so  less type job do  more why why company not other company why do move one other one so will try learn who be just general want understand what be that will make happy so will ask what will make thrive will also ask what will make unhappy be always very interesting learn lot people sometimes be very surprised do not expect negative question what make unhappy work hear great answer hear people do not like be micromanag like be responsible something people do not like repetition do not like boring thing when someone say want own something want trust love']"
