leadership tell what mountain be go climb people have define culture be who get promote who get hire who get fire be so visible really show what success look  company kind of define performance culture last thing be governance culture feel be area that really have not be not lot mid stage leader company  hard find information good governance   size stage be awkward place have know just be bunch people office back know garage somewhere be corporate company want make change front page website different text there be different who make decision do ceo have sign be product people market what be chain there find almost mid stage company  really loosely define so how do how do deal know how do deal deal communication reporting structure be all governance how do make decision do everybody speak same language decision  company so definitely want know ceo leadership really have know number be get set paint bold vision future company so everybody company really imagine fitting sheet paper everybody company should be able recite make sure be align top level then ceo be also responsible make sure there be money bank set cultural tone think there think  good have sort rhythm maybe not when be just really small upstart kind of get mid stage where quarterly system even be not public where there be goal setting accountability goal setting try be datum drive goal set possible early stage company run product today ad roll think  important goal be very much set outcome what metric do want drive output output example need ship product date why  really hard be go back customer centricity  hard really predict exactly what  customer be go want month now kind of go  journey so try focus more metric then actual roadmap item have sort rhythm quarterly basis kind fit big thematic big thematic initiative year be how have always do thing    there be always question do tie people compensation performance would say try keep separate performance goal set let take back compensation should be tie performance course when be set goal company be really suppose be more stretch base goal think big make sure be not think too small know come target would be good know reach percent  goal make part conversation when do review make sure people be be be set goal quarterly  also important make sure quarterly goal be not just focused quarter that be actually quarterly goal fit longer month theme else could have people just try make  number look right quarter lot different thing that product perspective really try focus do lot customer discovery be thing have be be interesting   not adderall be not consumer product mean  can be little more challenging find potential customer so have customer advisory board that have build which be great sometimes  customer advisory board can have lot early adopter which maybe not may be great like try new thing be open talk may not may not represent who  ultimate longterm customer be thing that have do last year be have sale team here use program call chorus record sale call get whole product team room play just just almost random sale call that happen  way hear customer respond kind of in example situation  product almost bunch art student kind critique critique what happen call what be say try get view customer actually even have conversation customer which find be pretty interesting  spurring lot really good conversation failure be part eel can not learn anything be not fail thing be not take be not do not have product fail do not have different issue feel mean be probably not take too many risk peter teal say be not be not uncomfortable be probably not do right so go back go back value again hire great people help grow there be book lot call mindset which be pretty popular book education circle cross apply business quite quite bit talk how set condition help people know make mistake thing have take recently be do fair bit retrospective do not make so retrospective be have big project fail instead just kind of shelve move  good break break really understand what happen problem be when be company  stage everybody so busy do not want take formalize too much so least create time space have structure look back thing make sure be actually take time learn  failure think people understand value process then be more likely understand  okay make mistake be good question actually thing that would have ask culture would be thing think  kind of there be thing can relate be first one be how do measure culture which think be really important  sorta how can go back idea have where there be think myth out there be company get big culture get bad get more bureaucratic more stuffy thing get slow there be diseconomie scale be hell bent destroy myth so actually company get big how do make sure company improve think think measurement will be part so use software call culture amp have lot company do actually once year have big employee survey ask bunch question everything how run company year when think  salary do have diverse inclusive environment people answer question allow basically really encourage whole company answer then get result back be able see different department different geography where hotspot be where be adroll be little different where do really well be really focus address hotspot immediately launch different program year help bring improve area improve culture so be able really diagnostic  culture open can be really helpful tool then other thing say be question would have dollar question be do think culture be can get good company grow size think think be early day think there be lot economy scale actually improve culture have kind different type people company be work together create great environment thank have take care grow seattle bellevue be

important information heart really be able secure manage content which be obviously space that know love deeply have thing gdpr have very specific industry regulation then have datum residence then have cybersecurity challenge company be deal just massive nightmare how do modernize way that  organization work way collaborate way that accomplish  daily task new challenge that have decade decade legacy technology company have manage  datum center  particular category there be probably be spend year technology customer datum center well be try go company fortune say listen can deliver much

do not have right compliance have ability go serve  customer that be big issue foundation everything do be security robustness reliability thing that ensure large regulated company can have safe place  content certainly have consumer movement that impact how technology work enterprise be part movement when found company year ago do not really think consumer enterprise just say people want be able share collaborate use business environment consumer environment folklore be always good start company focus people basically independent market be do not think be business consumer just focus people what happen be  business model change year half launch where say do not think there be viable business consumer market then start buy suit start look more serious start die  hair gray now have way too much year half past year have basically be percent market realize money be go be enterprise fortunately have decade headstart trend consumerization enterprise technology idea why workplace be use bad technology  personal life when actually spend way more money technology workplace there be variety reason just legacy enterprise software vendor never care user experience factor now finally have not lock yet monopoly control datum do not really matter buyer be buyer not end user end user really have power affect kind decision that be be make software development process that be change past couple year think  important obviously silicon valley dynamic be feel  box dropbox environment think would recognize market be obviously far big have go public probably wish be just head head battle reality be have microsoft have have more traditional company emc other be where actual spend be go how company manage  information  datum  job startup public startup be make sure be out innovate much large incumbent market deliver much good user experience be fundamentally more open integrate rest technology ecosystem which be not something that microsoft be particularly suit then make sure can constantly out innovate big competition  competitive advantage fundamentally startup be can move faster can get close customer better serve be much more open interoperable rest  technology landscape would say there be difference facebook microsoft just term  helpful do not break  talking point so significantly  good just believe  corporate marketing message be very good satyas really great leader s get great set team  be incredible see how s just matter year completely transform very different bomber style term organization kind of see juncture enterprise market be face right now be go repeat think mistake which be give power company know name company oracle world microsoft world enterprise industry big company say would actually rather have innovation come multitude vendor slack workplace facebook servicenow workday salesforce want technology company be really really deeply integrated one benefit that be go get enterprise buyer be be go get constant innovation swing lane sector mash together do think be sure morgan stanley frank quattrone really think mash thing together be certainly fan fiction enterprise software industry may be trap have not yet do full zen experience no be there kind be not meditator think be good pool analogy be swim same direction giant pool basically there be pool next which have lane  just giant shark infested water that be just really yacht think be not even pool basically see future be go come do customer want innovation good breed vendor work together which mean even work microsoft incumbent do not mean  go be microsoft sudden disappear think be where startup side get wrong microsoft be go be dominant force technology effectively perpetuity question be will there also be space good breed technology that can deliver innovation that google make huge push think be see more success computing side so really infrastructure space just cloud compute what diane greene have be drive think suite doc gmail  more consumer could be  kid think also work adult use box have couple employee certainly there be nothing suite gmail that do not scale large enterprise think there be just traditional approach that corporate have which be okay be go be use microsoft exchange outlook be go use cloud microsoft there be new set technology have enterprise have lot smb be really where focus be  hard when have such have such incredible business model thing search android youtube do not even know certainly fly car probably be little bit more exciting do corporate security see video seem float water why have not do test flight be too neurotic test flight be actually dangerous be not crash water have get swim be right have see hover be  point  still buggy  still buggy can see  arm pop cloak can actually s few people can sergey just float around be future think be what be see customer look coca cola lilly pfizer ge  stack look very different would have year ago have workday have servicenow have salesforce have box work together not necessarily perfectly time get drive more think thing that  more insurgent ecosystem be go face be can work together deliver incredible experience jointly be as integrate what microsoft oracle be go be able provide demand way more consumer expectation have dramatically change have poll expectation workplace be say am not go fill expense report software that be year old that be just too painful be not go share file inside legacy system what do be bring  own tool create massive security vulnerability company then be where come say can hopefully solve whole problem will sound obtuse amorphous  really idea what do future work look be company that have employee have bunch practice have bunch behavior have bunch business process that have be codify decade decade be successful be retailer be car manufacturer be life science company how do begin change pace innovation how do begin change speed which make decision drive new product market how do get close  customer whole idea digital age be really mean be business be move lot fast customer have way high expectation do not respond be go get disrupt think where enterprise software be go have go where customer be demand go be say how do begin work digital age how do begin appreciate be synopsis talking point obviously know idea amazon pizza team much more modular innovation where small team be able work much broad technology stack deliver customer innovation local customer that be not how percent world work that be not how large company that be build very slow year business process get new product market customer have request new expectation then entire giant ship have turn just little bit  faster just use new tool then question be how do large company get point where can have small team that be much more agile that be much close customer part  culture be chro large fortune enterprise be say have change  culture  organization get there be cio side also have have modern technology stack that be thing slack that be go let have team collaboration small level that be much more local around specific business problem specific product hmm be way more zen stuff read have hear name do not read kind of be right be always remove thing that be exactly what principle be exactly what most organization need be able have  environment then question be okay be fortune company be cpg company sudden have tool that make easy share real time make  organization much more open much more transparent that be fuck culture be use environment where information be power have very extreme hierarchy term how make decision organization sudden year old just come college may have good idea new product how do culture organization begin adapt fact have flat environment where good idea can come anywhere where people need lot more transparency have information make type decision faster what do mean traditional corporate structure what do mean how company be run operate be exciting set change that be come thank  company think people just have incredibly low expectation what expect twitter do not think  think  everybody else appreciate thank be actor studio something feel room would say there be probably unfortunately there be not that much thought process other try say what be  mind can kind of word way that people then feel good when get like think twitter fascinating outlet be able get  thought grow very mean internet be core  be grow so be just chat forum more  more broadcast chat forum mean unfortunately not lot methodology just tweet thank sometimes be mean airline that be general try not be too mean just way life do think election cycle get little bit more casual nature trump stuff general think that have have try focus policy oppose politician think  hard maintain sort policy orient structure just give amount climate that be in be  general approach then again just try not overthink too much delete tweet sometimes that be just stupid will type something then  mom will text will be be really stupid will be be right mom then delete will call tweet will just be tweet be not funny be not funny do not make sense will be be right will be misspell something will be fuck so have go delete get lot real time text  mom twitter issue have good editor just imessage do would accidentally tweet then would be sort of awkward so be speech language pathologist like word like have pronounce accurately so be up seattle work year old be level help tend give need well think aside second think twitter be hand  amazing platform  give anybody voice anywhere world that be awesome do not think anybody would say forget arab spring just community that now have much broad voice that be awesome same time also can see  harassment  lot more anger negativity area do not know how solve do not know how do not well then now do not have medium really do not know shareholder be really be okay be benevolent that be certainly approach private equity be just buy thing shut just pray get return there be return know call bill bill gate see can help endeavor could could think be deal lot harassment would just buy twitter shut do not know what do be jack dorsey have incredible democratizing force that can have bring lot good world same have all other challenge that maybe magically machine learning help maybe just have hire editor know editor that can do all different control abuse kinda claim think something need change do not think be good spot think need continue evolve how do assess mean think  kinda wish have never discover twitter be mean measurement bad way do not follow do not even follow do not know what do probably just like supreme court exclamation point have not do many cap try spell thing good do kinda stuff thank be sure that draw houston do not like that much be good well think situation be right now think be awakening how much responsibility valley have basically role technology platform kind of have impact  democracy know how world literally function think company facebook google other be wake  role society much more extreme way less intellectual way think  always intellectually people have know now  emotional can feel so actually be down be bullshit think problem be thing be not binary  increase boil frog issue zuckerberg know impact facebook when do thing where year beacon thank so know impact could actually hurt people personal life publish thing that people do not know be publish do not know ever do scenario say let imagine have nation state that be try impact  election what be way that could manipulate election how many degree could that become away nation state would not even know be come could be actually rout somebody else be fun conversation have completely hypothetical way then see happen real start realize what have create here so be sure extent  bullshit say be of sudden surprised impact think what be see be all sort new compounding layer way that platform be impact world mean be founder least know origin process how company get create be generally only think positive thing when be start be year old be be go build cool startup that can solve how people socially network other be not think well what russia hack thing so then  core ethos company do not have deep paranoia skepticism think possible way could break be really think more optimistic scenario what family member be more connect all world what could stay touch somebody go college year ago so then be real world be way more serious there be way more apocalyptic way use thing know what should do have career job chief risk officer chief paranoia officer chief nag cno would be great could probably do bunch company that be depressing may be accurate may be pessimistic then will solve way faster elon musk be probably very aligned one s out too well sure be talk full universe be too bad ais go work do not have worry ai point not personally would go there be consequence could get back week right be  point  like week long kind of endeavor absolutely would love go mar not can not do life change sort thing can not be uproot right now just have too many priority right now have job can not take time mar moment totally maybe day would be position where could think mar be just try store file right now mar be just so much think what happen reckoning so be go say have sort multinational challenge which be democracy risk nation state cybersecurity then have very local issue housing what be do  local community then diversity inclusion why be company so hard get so closed why be not able impact leadership rank company diversity inclusion standpoint so think there be lot stuff where have get get  house order be take variety different work stream be cultural be policy be technological be broad community thing think what just need be consistent push back  company need continue see path remediate improve tension majority do not know probably so be silicon valley then rest be distribute other country mostly here think problem have be lack focus prioritizing issue leadership team ceo think could definitely blame pipeline do not know have fully read brotopia be actually real interesting today be blame pipeline cause pipeline problem that be create decade ago so  create very problem that be now face be blame pipeline that do not see podcast so think fundamentally have be focus ceo leadership team organization which mean have evolve  hiring practice have evolve  recruiting program have think internal promotion equitability so have get make sure do not have very small pocket group that be sort of not fully integrate rest culture organization which obviously also mean have get critical mass  organization have look lot more broad population so do not think there be silver bullet other be focus priority joelle emerson be deeply focused issue be lawyer training do lot public interest law kind employee lawsuit whatnot kind of realize there be legal dimension which be let sue when harassment have get so bad also there be cultural dimension which be why do not just fix underlie practice that harassment diversity issue so lot  own evolution personally when think have obviously kind of be influence again  sort how hire how would track talent how retain talent then culture that be drive inclusion standpoint dimension matter would say few thing that have do well think have implement rooney rule basically which be leadership hire director above so not just  executive staff population few leader box make sure have couple candidate be able hire anybody be dramatically change mix candidate pool that look  changed impact direction hire which then go change hiring will then do  own team now have leader that may be woman person color be area have try put huge focus internal inclusion so focus  employee research group organization internally that be mean drive much more community company then be able hear lesson issue that different group be face how do good support immigrant how do better support  latinx population how do make sure be know thing be much more tie culture company think  make sure hold team accountable diversity rank  organization look metric single quarter population individual function boxs sale marketing engineering ensure think  trend much good direction where can get gender standpoint least next few year then additional program recruiting side create fellowship program call box business fellow where go hbcus try have people come box week learn all role  company not just engineering side all business rol sale finance recruiting then use way hopefully create little bit more opening valley individual who would not have think would have career silicon valley be school atlanta  logical opportunity be go coca cola go consult firm be say actually silicon valley have lot more job just crazy ai engineer that read when see news  bunch kind program just make priority leadership team be able drive probably not pressure be more outspoken  more think  just maybe  nature maybe already be outspoken type topic obviously be very focused try drive much good dialogue immigration front hopefully ultimately policy change do not think be go see anything next couple year do not think would not matter what use case be would be pretty horrid be definitely get arena where be have really interesting difficult question that company be face think maybe be just fortunate  government operation be so nascent have not have deal have not have deal issue be  ai be use drone know kinda dodge bullet be too early scale standpoint think be where have listen pulse organization where  definitely not space unilateral decision think employee have be passionate company that work have be passionate technology that come work day go build be be use way that be align  purpose now problem be there be not homogenous purpose company generally speak there be share ethic share belief how company work so think feel  technology be be use harm other people make america bad place again kind employee community that work think would decline kind contract officially official answer be something her deal do about last year be path guide do year be market that be think spend year so be so early space so  goal be make sure can capture as much possible companys goal be make sure capture as much possible generally lead be want be independent public company that be have listen think definitely go entire process think through ask what be really try build offer come think have use same framework past year which be do believe there be way bright future ahead independent company do think need pair somebody big be able accomplish what be try do so far have always land there be bright future ahead independent company can actually go take as much opportunity independent organization need pair somebody big class whatev  actually really interesting work think little new depend how classify that think  totally right think part  there be not lot opportunity be just be just solve slight gap incumbent have incumbent just go mow so be build tweak search engine tweak social network  so easy be fast follower be facebook be market that remember week half be right be long weekend be cool think be what happen so many space be try build next photo share app  not go work so just sorry break news so think then question be where be next opportunity technology company frankly be market that take lot longer build so  go be health care  go be life science maybe well continue see more innovation education  go be manufacture be not market that facebook become dollar company year be not particularly viral do not just spread overnight people think be reality era that be in right now which be next airbnb next uber next lyft next box be go be not just solve deficiency exist technology industry be go go out solve very different kind problem use technology enable bring back  enterprise cloud content management platform online cloud storage  really lame be why  evaluation be very low begin  first funding round be post money valuation be basically mom be neighbor mom local folk seattle be day when do angel round cuban be investor month then get tired think be too annoying fortunately have not be ask what else would do think would be go market would have be non be not again solve problem that microsoft oracle be try solve do not know  be do not know think be lot money think what be happen be so there be difference do microsoft have too much power dimension society that be really interesting conversation do control too much how live  daily life answer second will let be person answer next question be do control too much power silicon valley relate startup survival  hard do not know facebook should not be able copy little app that be say government regulatory pressure well challenge be do not know where break company be go give facebook news feed that be go be now different independent company be all mini conglomerate not mini massive conglomerate semi overlap more careful be almost aggregate  customer what be be certainly not run not exactly how use  product totally agree think be actually probably block most country would be dilemma government face which be what should regulation look relate silicon valley there be not single regulation could have there be probably campaign advertising regulation there be probably how should medical device use ai future how should  transportation future transportation infrastructure work have self drive car so there be probably wholesale regulation could apply vast just fierce nature company difference space occupy what need though be probably major regulatory body agency super super savvy regulator that be look industry lens world ai world machine learn when utility be actually no longer objective utility instead make decision behalf  consumer what news be go see news feed unfortunately which person maybe have be harm self drive car accident be fundamental decision which mean need regulator actually weigh society what be outcome that want do find acceptable be question that be so early incapable answering industry as well government that be focus so know how regulate red hen do not know do not know why have not be there why have not do podcast there thank would love stop news feed think what be worried would be customer serve serve probably top life scienc company many lead bank many lead hospital be almost proxy regulate build software technology regulated customer have pretty large compliance legal function box already be more less regulated  customer base so think bad case scenario be silicon valley get so far behind issue that just can not be trust industry then start have company other country have just completely different approach architecture technology rely fortune trusting silicon valley technology extent  success when see tool can be manipulate be be use more harmful way regulator be stamp then that think impact anybody be consumer enterprise so actually have extremely strong vested interest ensure silicon valley be operate effectively so do not know will be box specifically be regulate be outcome care get mess facebook resolve  issue resolve  issue so  contagion  go reduce trust type platform do not know how love do not know love quotient moment will take  word think be low love state right now percent job thing think industry again perfectly similar cambridge analytica facebook thing way too cavalier lack empathy how be people go perceive technology roll industry be people go be able learn how use be competitive  job be go be able be retrain area now same time would say be still very early process so rhetoric probably exceed actual job disruption that be actually occur be come which mean  time get ahead now start have conversation there use be file cabinet so person administer file cabinet have probably least get rid file cabinet job globally would not be employ be  only job do should be cloud who keep all  file be just leverage future need do print podcast later something have file would be be not go mess have get document okay have get pdfs be think again maybe be nave optimism naive optimism silicon valley general when look  technology when look salesforce workday kinda tool think actually what be see be company can be more efficient particular area  collaboration sale process  not hire few people   business be able better serve  customer actually often will create more job more everything talk point  just word let give really bad example very local example do not want judge do not want judge  example what  example not good be be stupid fucking example ever hear so box have datum science team  job be make  business process more efficient have process which be try identify lead that be most likely close so  sale rep be able better serve  customer invent good algorithm that could do much good way can better sell  customer do not result hire few sale rep mean could actually hire more people  sale process be more efficient so now something that be inefficient previously particular area get more efficient which mean could actually fund more be now economically viable way go serve particular customer base so think what have remember be have not reach exact perfect symmetry supply demand globally what have reach be perfect symmetry supply demand today level efficiency so could make transportation tenth price could dramatically increase number people that be consume service same health care same consumer product have inefficiency everywhere so technology can make particular job particular process more efficient potentially will actually hire more people do task now  not actually be able better serve customer be able do then have get all indirect ad job nobody really track so truck driver be why begin say be bad example be not go go direction do not wanna even use now no be go say not even sure also just think all surround industry that grow when can go make logistic more efficient have be thoughtful fact there may be specific task that change do not necessarily mean entire job change even when entire job change then what have do be find way route labor different part market do not mean fall trap be sorry  only talking point would just be when atms first come think be go destroy bank teller job have probably reach peak bank teller past couple year there be stat that be more retail branch moment that atm be invent do not take specific number banking grow now be more accessible people thus growth bank explode percent be why again wanna make sure be not give out anybody that be not think be just say there will be commensurate maybe not commensurate quantitative there will be everything that make more efficient there will likely be job growth direct area surround function what have do silicon valley be be way more thoughtful identify area growth make sure there be impact job how do ensure more people can discover new opportunity how train think be more responsibility silicon valley do not think somehow should be fully exempt think do not change think  market job be go be college that be go be community college that be go be online education that be go be company do retrain then be go be government hopefully get ahead just tad can tilt where do want education go where do want public school be move may have wait couple more year be hockey right unfortunately  go sound little bit similar what be talk couple advertisement break ago idea business be get fast company no matter what industry be have serve customer much more digitally drive way again be hospital how do provide experience patient be life science company how do learn what andme be do have more precise experience personalize medicine be transportation know be go be move be more demand more rental base probably less ownership car companys go be digitize industry be go be digitize  job box probably job largely enterprise software space be provide tool provide weaponry that help company modernize  work place  business process so where be go be go be literally entire spectrum wanna power how company work share collaborate just datum that be able move  organization wanna be platform application be build application relate content manage so be bank how do have good experience  customer where can exchange document seamlessly do not have fax document do not have fedex datum information anymore be so there go be paper people love paper people mean still have market as long there be paper people have customer now see  opportunity there be law there be security exactly most people be usually year behind term actually state compliance regulatory parameter call paper people be people that also have filing cabinet probably do  first internship be paramount picture that be where get idea box not first internship could have be file movie studio get idea box be literally fax information literally be paper person that be what do intern so put document filing cabinet then fax fedexd be holy shit be crazy be contract love lucy rural america literally contract would be rerun residual love lucy be literally just fax back forth so nothing glamorous whatsoever think may have see lisa kudrow once be drive golf cart be golf cart let use golf cart intern have move all paper around can not do would have love move script around be just contract again think be distance  not even clear be time have imagine be celebrity good celebrity that have meet really be time run harrison ford try explain cloud compute be good moment  life be really brief conversation do not go very far think be why be front be pretty cool be now should be would love now could just respond tweet dt good chat everyone have start mentality still be small enough where get right kind energy dedication everyone feel really part what be do people be able question other strategy be market
